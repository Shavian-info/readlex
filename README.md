The Kingsley Read Lexicon: a spelling dictionary for the Shavian alphabet following the rhotic Received Pronunciation standard.

The Kingsley Read Lexicon is presented as a TSV document with five columns representing:
1. the Latin alphabet spelling
2. the Shavian alphabet spelling
3. The part of speech (POS) tagged according to the [C5 tagset used in the British National Corpus](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/docs/c5spec.html)
4. The Received Pronunciation based pronunciation adopted for the purpose of the Shavian spelling in the International Phonetic Alphabet. This includes some additional information in CAPITAL LETTERs, namely the standard word signs are “the” Ð, “to” T, “and” N, “of” V, and “for” F. The reinserted Rs not normally found in RP are represented by a capital R. Both options for the TRAP-BATH split and the TRAP-BATH merger are represented by capital Ɑː and capital Æ respectively. Some Shavian conventions around the spelling of /ə/ and unstressed /ɪ/ in some contexts are given as Ə and I, and both are transliterated as 𐑩 for the purposes of the Kingsley Read Lexicon. The voiceless /ʍ/ is also distinguished from /w/ for those who want it (e.g. to generate Quikscript spellings), but for the purposes of the Kingsley Read Lexicon both are transliterated as 𐑢. Words for which no pronunciation has yet been added have \N in this column.
5. The word frequency from the British National Corpus, for statistical interest and supporting predictive text applications.

The files readlex.dict, addendum.dict (which contains mainly proper names, initialisms and ephemera), and trapbathmerger.dict (which contains the TRAP-BATH merged forms of words which are common in US English among others) are adapted for use with the transliteration scripts available at https://www.dechifro.org/shavian/.
